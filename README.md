# Backend-Mussel-Control

Code developed for the course "[22400 Design-build 4: Autonomous devices for controlling and studying living systems](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/22400)" (June 2022) at DTU. 

## Course Goals

The goal of the course is to create a bioreactor (a small model of an ecosystem) and to develop an autonomous solution through which it would be possible to grow mussels by feeding them algae - which is also grown in the set up. The work was done over a 3 week period in groups of 10 students of various backgrounds.

The code allows the groups to measure relevant parameters in the systems and to use such data to regulate the feeding of the algae and mussels. The system can also be viewed and controlled online on [Adafruit](https://io.adafruit.com/).

## Results

Final group score: 112/112 points
